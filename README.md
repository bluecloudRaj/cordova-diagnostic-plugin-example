# Important Android Note

The [master branch of the diagnostic plugin](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin) now supports Android 6 runtime permissions. The introduces a dependency which means that the project must be built against API 23 or above.

For users who wish to build against API 22 or below, there is a branch of the plugin repo which contains all the functionality __except Android 6 runtime permissions__. This removes the dependency on API 23 and will allow you to build against legacy API versions (22 and below).

There is also a corresponding branch of this project intended to be built with the legacy plugin version: [https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin-example/tree/api-22](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin-example/tree/api-22)

**NOTE**: Phonegap Build now supports API 23, so its users may use the main plugin branch (`cordova.plugins.diagnostic`).

# Downloading

To download the example project, clone it using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin-example

# Building and running

The plugin currently supports the Android and iOS platforms.

For example, to run on the Android platform, execute the following commands from the project root:

- Install the Android platform into the project: `$ cordova platform add android@latest`
- Build and run the project: `$ cordova run android`

## Testing Android runtime permissions

If you want to test out Android runtime permissions, you need to run the example app on a device/emulator with Android 6+.

Note: If the app is run on Android 5.1 (API 22)  or below, runtime permissions do not apply - all permissions are granted at installation time.
